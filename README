Release notes for Little Goblin v 0.3.1

Little Goblin is a browser game framework written in Groovy,
Java and a little bit of JavaScript. The WAR file is a intended
for testing and demonstration, and will create a basic usable
game environment as seen on the test server on http://schedim.de


On Tomcat or Jetty, it should deploy as http://localhost:8080/goblin,
but your system may be configured in another way.

Open source components contained therein may have different
(but generally compatible) Licenses like LGPL or BSD.

This is a Grails 2.2 application running on Java 7.

This code may link to images on the web which have their own copyright
 and licenses, which you should consider and review before going
 public with a game based upon LittleGoblin. Generally, it's best
 if you use your own images (and the ones supplied inside the WAR
 file).
